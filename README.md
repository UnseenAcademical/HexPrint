# HexPrint Wargame

# Introduction

Someday I’ll figure out what to write here.

# How to Win

Victory in this game is always determined by the mission.

# General Rules

The point of this game is to have fun with friends. The goal of this game is to guide your models to victory. Confusing the two is not recommended.

In case of a debate between players about the game, the players can all agree to either ask the judgement of a third party or to roll off for whose judgement call is correct for this match. If the debate relates to the rules of HexPrint, please ask a question / make a pull request to help clarify.

All dice in this game are d6s.

Always round up.

If a specific instance of a rule or effect contradicts a general rule, that instance takes priority. (For example, if an ability tells you to roll a d20, do so even though the rule above says that all dice are d6s.)

If you’re told to determine a single <thing> (such as “the closest <thing>”) and there are multiple <things> that qualify, determine randomly from among them unless the ability says you can choose.  

If an ability or effect says “a” or “an” <thing> then this ability or effect only impacts a single <thing>.

If it says “each” <thing> then it impacts multiple <things> based on its conditions. Unless stated otherwise, an "each" effect applies to every model matching the conditions. If there is a limit, it will be written "each <thing> up to five" or similarly.

If it says “friendly model” then it only affects a model you control that is NOT the source of the ability or effect.

If it says “enemy model” then it only affects a model you don’t control that is NOT the source of the ability or effect.

“Friendly” and “enemy” refer to the player controlling the ability or effect, not the model’s friends and enemies. This is important during certain types of faction or co-op play.

If it says “self” then its referring to the source of the ability or effect.

If it says “within X” where X is a number, then it means that you should count a number of hexes from the edge of a hex the model/terrain/effect is in to determine what is “within”. “Within” always includes the hex that is the source of the ability/effect.

If it says “at least X away” then it excludes all hexes within X-1.

# Beginning The Game

The first step is selecting a mission and game size.  If you are playing in a campaign/legacy format or other persistent game mode, this should be effectively already done, but otherwise come to an agreement with your opponent.

The mission will specify the board size and placement of any necessary terrain features and neutral models.

Each player then builds an army for the mission. Army selections will give terrain elements to your opponents. These terrain elements should be kept in “batches” according to the unit card that granted them.

Set up the board area as a flat space, then each player takes turn placing terrain and models. The defender places first (in a symmetrical mission, players roll off for first deployment). Each player places according to directions in the mission. Players may alternate placing terrain and models freely, with each placement either being the models from a card, or the terrain from a card.

Once the final models and terrain have been placed, put the Hex Timer next to the board. Start it on six.

Each player then places initiative markers on the Hex Timer for each unit card they have. For each segment a unit is placed “back” from one, put a positive counter on that unit’s card.

# Anatomy of a Game

## Time Turns

The Hex Timer moves forward by one segment (1>2>3>4>5>6>1>2>3>4>5>6>1)

All initiative markers on the indicated segment are taken off the Timer and set in their controlling player’s initiative pool.

When the Timer ticks from 6 to 1, that is the beginning of a new round. Resolve all “new round” effects at that point. Examples of these include abilities refreshing, mission parameters changing, or other relevant happenings.

## Determining Initiative

Each player rolls a d6 for each initiative marker they took off the timer this turn. The player with the highest total is the first player for this turn. Set these dice aside in each player’s initiative pool. They are not associated with a particular unit.

## Activations

The first player chooses a 6 they rolled, and removes it from the initiative pool. If they can’t, they pass the activation.

Then, the player selects a unit whose initiative marker is in their pool. This unit may take up to the number of actions listed on their card, or 5 actions, whichever is lower. Once those actions are complete, take the current segment that the Timer is on, and count “forward” a number of segments equal to the number of actions taken. Place the unit’s initiative marker on that segment.

Once that unit’s activation is complete, the next player can move onto activating one of their units.

Activations go in the following order:

* First player activates a 6 if possible.

* Second player activates a 6 if possible.

* Third player (then fourth, fifth, sixth…) activates a 6 if possible.

* Repeat this cycle until no player has a 6 in their initiative pool any longer.

* Repeat this entire process with each die number in the initiative pool (5s, 4s, etc)

* When all dice have been removed from all player’s initiative pools, terrain and neutral models activate in a random order. Each will have instructions on it for what to do when it activates.

* Once all activations have been completed, the turn is over and time turns.

## Ending the Game

The game ends immediately when the conditions the mission sets have been fulfilled.

If the mission does not specify a time limit, the game ends after three full rotations of the Hex Timer (the third time it turns to 6).

# Reading a Card

## Name

The name slot you fill in yourself

## Type

The type refers to the specific rules from the unit list that this unit is based on. Unless you are playing a legacy-style or campaign format, the stats on the card will directly match the stats matching this name in the unit list.

## Size

This section tells you how many models are in a unit of this type, and how big each model is. All models are identical.

## Unit Tags

These tags tell you relevant details about the models (such as “human” or “squad”) which may be used by other abilities and effects.

## Static Abilities

Static abilities are a set of abilities that are constantly active and do not require actions to use.

Static abilities can be damaged. While they are damaged, they are no longer active and do not have any effect.

## ACT (The Actions stat)

ACT refers to the number of actions a unit can take during their activation.

ACT can be damaged. While it is damaged, the unit can only take a single action on each of their activations, no matter how many bonus actions they might be granted by other effects.

## MOV (The Movement stat)

MOV refers to the number of hexes a unit can move for each action spent on movement.

MOV can be damaged. While it is damaged, the unit can only move a single hex for each action spent on movement, no matter if they have bonus movement.

## TAR (The Target stat)

TAR refers to the number that all this unit’s abilities and effects roll against. A TAR of “3+” for example, means that all dice rolled for this unit are counted as a success or a hit if the die shows a 3 or above.

TAR can be damaged. While it is damaged, dice rolled for this unit’s abilities and effects are only a success or hit on a rolled 6. (This means that if you give a unit with a damaged TAR a -1 TAR effect, a roll of 5 will still not be a success).

## Abilities

Non-static abilities on a unit’s card cost 1 action to use. Unless an ability specifies that it can only be used a certain number of times in a turn or a round, it can be used whenever an action can be spent on it. If it says that it is usable a number of times per turn, that refers to this specific Timer segment. If it says usable a number of times per round, the ability’s available uses refill when the Timer ticks over to the first segment.

Abilities can be damaged. While an ability is damaged, it cannot be used.

# Movement

## Placement

A model cannot move anywhere that you can’t physically place it. This means that certain models can take cover in bunkers, buildings, or other overhangs while others cannot.

## Forced Movement

All forms of forced movement must move at least one hex, but otherwise can be stopped short at any point. (For example, a model that is hit with an ability to “push 3” can be pushed one, two, or three hexes, but cannot be pushed zero hexes).

### Push

Push movement always has to end with the pushed model being further from the pushing model by at least a single hex of distance.

### Pull

Pull movement always has to end with the pulled model being closer to the pulling model by at least a single hex of distance.

### Slide

Slide movement can move a model in any direction with no restrictions.

## MOVement

When a model is activated to move, it is given a number of movement points equal to its MOV stat. Each type of terrain or tiles costs a certain amount of movement points to move into. Movement points do not have to be spent.

Models cannot move through other models without special abilities.

Multi-hex models cannot end their movement if all their hexes are not on the same height.

A model may choose instead to sacrifice its entire stock of movement points to move into ANY empty adjacent tile which can be entered willingly. This is to prevent model’s being completely trapped unintentionally.

# Damage

Damage is received from certain abilities. When a unit receives X points of damage, follow these steps:

## Marking Damage

In order to mark off a damage slot, roll a d6 to determine which ability or stat is to be marked. Then mark a damage box on that ability or stat. If you can’t mark that for some reason, instead reroll the d6 and mark the new roll. If all slots on an ability or stat are marked, that ability or stat is damaged. Damaged stats or abilities are reduced or disabled.

## Removal and Boxing

When a model is removed, place it somewhere off the board. Models that are removed can be brought back into the game via some means.

When a model is boxed, place it “back in its box”. This model cannot come back into the game via any method, even if a rule would normally put it back.

# Visibility

## Line of Sight and Cover

When attempting to check the line of sight between two models, follow this series of steps:

1. Bend down to "see" as best you can from the origin model to the target model.
2. If you can only see roughly 10% or less of the target model, the models don't have line of sight.
3. If you can see more than 10% but less than 50%, the model has full cover.
4. If you can see more than 50% but less than 80%, the model has partial cover.
5. If you can see more than 80%, the model has no cover.

If a model has partial or full cover and its blocked at all by a terrain piece with rules, apply any special rules on that terrain piece's card to the shot/effect/etc.

# Terrain

## General Rules

Unless specified otherwise, models can enter any hex that they can pay the MOV cost for.

Each step of elevation or height costs 1 movement point.

## Height

All terrain in HexPrint has a height associated with it. A normal land tile has a height of 1, for example. Two land tiles stacked on top of each other means the stack has a height of 2. This height is important for calculating line of sight and movement, but can also serve as a rules-based way to determine the correct terrain piece to print.

Height is always a round number. Any tile less than a height of 1 (for example, water tiles) is the height of the tile under it.

Certain models have special rules that interact with height.
